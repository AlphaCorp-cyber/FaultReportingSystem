## 🔧 **System Title**

**Web-Based Fault Reporting System for Redcliff Municipality’s Engineering Department**

---

## 🌍 **Context & Purpose**

The system is designed for **Redcliff Municipality**, a town in Zimbabwe’s Midlands Province. Redcliff faces challenges in managing public infrastructure due to **manual fault reporting methods** like phone calls and physical forms, which result in delays, poor traceability, and inefficiencies.

This system aims to transform fault reporting into a **digital, efficient, and transparent process** that empowers residents to report infrastructure issues and enables the municipality to respond effectively.

---

## 🧩 **System Overview**

The **Fault Reporting System** is a web-based platform that enables:

* **Residents** to report faults (like burst water pipes, potholes, broken streetlights).
* **Municipal staff** to receive, assign, track, and resolve these faults in real-time.

The system features:

* A centralized **relational database** to store all data securely.
* **Verification via payment records**, ensuring that only residents who have paid their municipal rates can submit fault reports.
* Integration of **data analytics** to identify recurring faults and optimize resource planning.
* A **responsive web interface**, accessible on desktops and mobile devices.

---

## 🚩 **Key Problems Addressed**

* Delays and inefficiencies in traditional fault reporting
* Poor accountability and lack of fault traceability
* Difficulty in managing repair prioritization
* Loss of public trust due to delayed responses

---

## 🎯 **System Aim**

To design and implement a fault reporting system that:

* Enhances the **efficiency** of logging, tracking, and managing faults.
* Leverages historical and real-time data to improve **response times**, accountability, and decision-making.
* Supports **smart urban governance** and aligns with Redcliff’s mission to be a city by 2030.

## ✅ **System Objectives**

1. Allow **verified residents** to report faults via a web interface.
2. Capture **detailed information and location** of faults.
3. Automatically allocate faults to the **correct municipal department**.
4. Provide **status updates** to residents.
5. Use historical data to **predict potential faults** in the town.

## 🧪 **Research Methods Used**

To understand the existing system and user needs, the following methods were applied:

* **Interviews** with municipal staff and residents.
* **Observations** of the current manual fault reporting process.
* **Questionnaires** distributed to gather structured data from users.

---

## 💡 **Justification / Benefits**

1. **Reduced workload** for staff through automation.
2. **Improved record-keeping** and access to historical data.
3. **Cost savings** on paper and administrative materials.
4. **Proactive maintenance** through fault prediction analytics.
5. **Increased transparency and public trust** through real-time tracking and accountability.

---

## 🧠 **Core System Functionalities**

* **Resident login with verification** against the municipal payment records.
* **Online fault submission** form with categories (e.g., water, roads, electricity).
* **Admin dashboard** for municipal staff to view, assign, and update faults.
* **Notification system** to inform residents of progress and resolution.
* **Report generation** and analytics dashboard for planning and performance evaluation.

---

## 🧭 **Organizational Fit**

The system supports the mission of Redcliff Municipality:

> “To provide affordable, quality services and a pleasant living environment... promoting sustainable economic development.”

Its centralized management structure and push toward smart governance make it an ideal environment to adopt such a system.

---

## 🏁 **Conclusion**

This digital fault reporting system:

* Bridges the gap between residents and municipal staff.
* Enables data-driven, efficient service delivery.
* Reduces delays, manual errors, and public dissatisfaction.
* Sets a foundation for Redcliff to transition into a **smart city** model.
